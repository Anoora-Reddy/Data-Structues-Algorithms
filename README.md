Stack

    Stack is a data structure which will follow FILO or LIFO
    Push() - Will insert an element into Stack
    Pop()  - Will remove an element from Stack
    Peek() - Will return last element of Stack
    get_Stack() - Will return the Stack
    is_empty() - return a boolean valule by checking if the Stack is empty or not
    
    Sample Problems:
        1. Balanced Parenthesis
        2. Integer to Binary
        


###Tree
    
    Tree is a non linear data structure which is defined as a collection of entities (nodes) linked togeather to simulate a hierarchy.
    
    Basic Terminologies...
    
    <h4>Root Node</h4>
    The first node from where the tree originates is called as a root node.
    
    Edge
    The connecting link between any two nodes is called as an edge.
    In a tree with n number of nodes, there are exactly (n-1) number of edges.
          
    Parent Node
    Immediate ancestor of any node is called a Parent Node.
    In a tree, a parent node can have any number of child nodes.
                 
    Child Node
    Immediate decendent of any node is called a Child Node.
    All the nodes except root node are child nodes.
